# Maliks-Linux-Roblox-Wrapper

This Roblox wrapper was designed for new and beginner Linux users to quickly get Roblox up and running as easy as possible.

### Setup ###

Download latest release from https://github.com/msmalik681/Maliks-Linux-Roblox-Wrapper/releases the file "Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh" and make it executable from terminal in the same directory run "chmod +x Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh" in most modern distros you can just right click on the file select properties then permissions and check the box to allow executing as program.

Once the file is executable just run it. Open a terminal window then drag and drop the file in there then press return to run it or open a terminal in the same directory and run "./Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh" .

During the install you will be asked if you want to install or uninstall DXVK I recommend installing without it if everything is working you do not need it. but if Roblox will not start or runs really bad run the setup again but choose to install it this time.

### Roblox Studio ###

Studio can only be run after Roblox is installed it does not seem very stable I have enabled Vulkan as the default graphics api as it is the most stable. If you having trouble with this you could try grapejuice. If you can not run Roblox without DXVK then studio will not work.
