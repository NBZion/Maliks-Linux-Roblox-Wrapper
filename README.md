# Maliks-Linux-Roblox-Wrapper

This Roblox wrapper was designed for new and beginner Linux users to quickly get Roblox up and running as easy as possible.

### Setup ###

Download the file "Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh" and make it executable from terminal in the same directory run "chmod +x Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh" in most modern distros you can just right click on the file select properties then permissions and check the box to allow executing as program.

One the file is executable just run it. Open a terminal window then drag and drop the file in there then press return to run it.

You will be asked what distro you are using you will have to identify this before you proceed there are hundreds of Linux distros Ubuntu(Debian) is the most common. If your not sure maybe check the project page for the distro you are using.

During the install you will be asked if you want to install DXVK I recommend installing without it if everything is working you do not need it. but if Roblox will not start or runs really bad run the setup again but choose to install it this time.

Once Roblox is installed and you press the green button to exit the graphical setup this script will hang press return to end it and you are done.

### Roblox Studio ###

Studio can only be run after Roblox is installed it does not seem very stable I have enabled Vulkan as the default graphics api as it is the most stable. If you having trouble with this you could try grapejuice.
